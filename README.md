üéØ Insights Gained

The majority of sales are concentrated in North America and Western Europe.

High discounts often reduce profit margins significantly, even when sales volume increases.

Standard Class shipping generates the highest order volume, but other modes vary in profitability.

Top cities such as New York and Los Angeles drive the highest sales, yet profitability varies significantly, with some cities generating losses despite strong revenue.

The Consumer segment is the largest contributor to overall sales.

Sales over time reveal fluctuations rather than steady growth, highlighting the need for strategies that drive sustainable, long-term revenue increases instead of short-term spikes.
